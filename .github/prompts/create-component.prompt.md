# Create React Component

You are tasked with creating a new React component for the Reactive Resume application. 

## Requirements:
- Use TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Follow the existing component patterns in `libs/ui`
- Use TailwindCSS for styling with the `cn()` utility
- Implement proper accessibility features
- Export as named export (not default)
- Use Radix UI primitives when appropriate

## Component Structure:
```typescript
type ComponentProps = {
  // Define props interface
};

export const ComponentName = ({ }: ComponentProps) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

## Guidelines:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries if needed
- Add JSDoc comments for complex props
- Support theming and customization
- Test with screen readers in mind
- Follow the existing design system patterns

Please create the component based on the requirements provided in the chat.
